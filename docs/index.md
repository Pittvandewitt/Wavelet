# Quick start guide

You installed [Wavelet] but it doesn't seem to work out of the box... Try these steps to get started quickly!

- Most of the time you simply need to start playing some music before you're able to change settings in Wavelet
- Some music players don't work out of the box. Check out [Music player setup] and follow the steps for the music player you use (if it's listed)
- It is good practice to follow the instructions on [dontkillmyapp]. By completing the instructions, your device will allow Wavelet to detect music playback and not cause interruptions
- Check out the [Troubleshooting] page
